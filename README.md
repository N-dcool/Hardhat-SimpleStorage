# Hardhat Simple Storage


# Getting Started

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - You'll know you've installed nodejs right if you can run:
    - `node --version` and get an output like: `vx.x.x`
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) instead of `npm`
  - You'll know you've installed yarn right if you can run:
    - `yarn --version` and get an output like: `x.x.x`
    - You might need to [install it with `npm`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) or `corepack`

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/n-dcool/Hardhat-SimpleStorage

cd Hardhat-SimpleStorage

yarn

yarn hardhat
```

## Typescript

For the typescript edition, run:

```
git checkout typescript
```
# Useage

Deploy:

```
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

## Testing

```
yarn hardhat test
```

### Test Coverage

```
yarn hardhat coverage
```

### Optional Gitpod

If you can't or don't want to run and install locally, you can work with this repo in Gitpod. If you do this, you can skip the `clone this repo` part.

# Usage

Deploy:

```
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

## Testing

```
npx hardhat test
```

### Test Coverage

```
npx hardhat coverage
```

## Estimate gas

You can estimate how much gas things cost by running:

```
npx hardhat test
```

And you'll see and output file called `gas-report.txt`

## Local Deployment 

If you'd like to run your own local hardhat network, you can run:

```
npx hardhat node
```

And then **in a different terminal**

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

And you should see transactions happen in your terminal that is running `npx hardhat node`

### Important localhost note

If you use metamask with a local network, everytime you shut down your node, you'll need to reset your account. Settings -> Advanced -> Reset account. Don't do this with a metamask you have real funds in. And maybe don't do this if you're a little confused by this. 

## Deployment to a testnet or mainnet

1. Setup environment variables

You'll want to set your `GOERLI_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` as environment variables. You can add them to a `.env` file, similar to what you see in `.env.example`.

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your account (like from [metamask](https://metamask.io/)). **NOTE:** FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
  - You can [learn how to export it here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).
- `GOERLI_RPC_URL`: This is url of the goerli testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

2. Get testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some tesnet ETH. You should see the ETH show up in your metamask.

3. Deploy

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

# Typescript differences

1. `.js` files are now `.ts`
2. We added a bunch of typescript and typing packages to our `package.json`
3. The biggest one being [typechain](https://github.com/dethcrypto/TypeChain)
   1. This gives your contracts static typing, meaning you'll always know exactly what functions a contract can call. 
   2. This gives us `factories` that are specific to the contracts they are factories of. See the tests folder for a version of how this is implemented. 
4. We use `imports` instead of `require`. Confusing to you? [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK54Cn4ceac)
5. Add `tsconfig.json`
